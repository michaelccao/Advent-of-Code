2017 Day 17 - Simple solution if you put some thought
2017 Day 23 - Intended purpose of machine vs supposed complexity of its instruction
2018 Day 5 - Proper approach gives simple solution
2018 Day 8 - Cute recursion problem
2018 Day 19 - Same basic twist as 2017 Day 23
2019 Day 7 - Very satisfying OO implementation
2019 Day 12 - Hilariously large answer for Part 2 (Mine was 326,365,108,375,488)
2019 Day 13 - Really cool that the code instructions simulates breakout.
2019 Day 20 - Interesting part 2 maze solved with smarter caching
